## About Organized

Take care of the little jobs with Organized, a new widget from iSlayer featuring a calendar with events, world clocks, notes and to do’s.

The calendar and to do’s utilise OS X’s inbuilt databases, so they’re always in sync with iCal and Mail. The world clock uses our very own database with over 700 locations.

## Note

I'm not the author, I just really like this little world clock/calender view so mirroring this.
